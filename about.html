                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a second-year law student with a strong interest in constitutional law, gender justice, and digital media regulation. Along with my regular coursework, I actively participate in moot courts, research on LGBTQ+ rights, and study contemporary issues such as intermediary liability and online content regulation. I also enjoy working on legal drafting, including contracts and policy-oriented writing, which helps me strengthen my analytical skills and build a practical understanding of the law.</p>

                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>My name is Yuvaraj, and I am from Karnataka, India. I am currently pursuing my law degree at Christ University, Pune Lavasa campus, where I am building a strong foundation in legal concepts and critical thinking. As a law student, I am particularly interested in issues of rights, equality, and social justice, and I hope to use my legal education to contribute meaningfully to society in the future.

</p>

                    <h2>My Legal Journey</h2>
                    <p>My legal journey so far has been a blend of academic learning and practical exposure as a second-year law student. I have completed three internships in different regions, starting with my first internship in Hyderabad, followed by one in Karnataka, and another in Kathmandu, Nepal, which helped me understand diverse legal practices and work environments. Along with internships, I have actively participated in three moot courts and several debates, which have strengthened my research, advocacy, and public speaking skills and deepened my interest in the legal profession.

</p>

                    <h2>Areas of Legal Interest</h2>
                    <p>My primary areas of interest include:</p>
                    <ul class="interest-list">
                        <li><strong>Constitutional Law:</strong> The structure of government, individual rights, and constitutional interpretation</li>
                        <li><strong>Contract Law:</strong> The formation, interpretation, and enforcement of agreements</li>
                        <li><strong>Civil Procedure:</strong> The rules and processes that govern civil litigation</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Research & Writing:</strong> The skills necessary for effective legal communication</li>
                        <li><strong>Jurisprudence:</strong> The philosophy of law and its application in modern society</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Purpose of This Blog</h2>
                    <p>This blog serves as both a learning tool and a resource for others interested in legal education and issues of gender and equality. Through case briefs, explanations of legal concepts, analysis of important decisions, and reflections on gender justice, I aim to make complex legal and social principles more accessible. The content here reflects my ongoing studies and personal interpretations—it is meant to educate, highlight questions of equality and inclusion, and stimulate discussion, not to serve as legal advice.​

</p>

                    <h2>Why I Write</h2>
                    <p>Writing about legal topics helps me deepen my own understanding while contributing to the legal community's collective knowledge. I believe that legal literacy is important for informed citizenship, and I'm committed to breaking down complex concepts into digestible, well-reasoned explanations. Whether you're a fellow law student, someone curious about the legal system, or a legal professional, I hope you'll find value in these insights.</p>
